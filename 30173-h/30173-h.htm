<h3><i>PREFACE</i><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p><i>Fors Clavigera!&mdash;to the ignorant a stumbling-stone,
to the Philistines a laughing-stock, but
to the Initiate a sweet remembrance of many
a happy hour passed in informal chat with the
Master.</i></p>

<p><i>The real Ruskin enthusiast has read every
word of Fors, and reckons it not least among the
precious treasures of the Master's pen. But it
remains a fact that to the vast majority of those
who have heard of Fors Clavigera, it is but an
excellent example of Ruskin's eccentric seeking
after curious titles; and the beauties of
these letters are as effectually buried as if they
had appeared in a country journal.</i></p>

<p><i>It is in the desire of rescuing one of the
choicest bits in all Fors that the present little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
booklet is offered to the clients of the "Celestial
Lily" as Mother Church names the noble
Martyr, St. Ursula. Though, of course, a life
of this royal maiden has an interest for me
apart from its authorship by Ruskin.</i></p>

<p><i>As one dedicated to the cause for which the
little Princess and her "legions" lost their
lives, as one tenderly devoted to her and as
privileged to be sheltered beneath her protecting
mantle, I look upon this story as one of
the sweetest relics of the "Age of Faith." It
makes no difference to me, as it made none to
John Ruskin (and thank God there are many
like him), what learned Bollandists and others
tell us of the legendary character of the Princess
of Over-sea. The essential thing, as
Ruskin remarked, is that a great people chose
so to represent their highest aspirations. It
will remain eternally true, to use his words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that "we see the Saints better through a nimbus
of religious enthusiasm than a fog of contemptuous
rationalism."</i></p>

<p><i>To all who, like Ursula, love holy living
and unselfish dedication to a noble cause,
greeting</i>&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>THE STORY OF ST. URSULA</i><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p><i>There was once a just and most Christian
King of Britain, called Maurus. To him and
to his wife Daria was born a little girl, the
fairest creature that this earth ever saw. She
came into the world wrapped in a hairy mantle,
and all men wondered greatly what this might
mean. Then the King gathered together his
wise men to inquire of them. But they could
not make known the thing to him, for only God
in Heaven knew how the rough robe signified
that she should follow holiness and purity all
her days, and the wisdom of St. John the
Baptist. And because of the mantle, they
called her Ursula, 'Little Bear.'</i></p>

<p><i>Now Ursula grew day by day in grace and
loveliness, and in such wisdom that all men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>marvelled. Yet should they not have marvelled,
since with God all things are possible.
And when she was fifteen years old she was
a light of all wisdom, and a glass of all beauty,
and a fountain of Scripture and of sweet ways.
Lovelier woman there was not alive. Her
speech was so full of all delight that it seemed
as though an angel of Paradise had taken human
flesh. And in all the kingdom no weighty
thing was done without counsel of Ursula.</i></p>

<p><i>So her fame was carried through the earth,
and a King of England, a heathen of Over-sea,
hearing, was taken with the love of her. And
he set all his heart on having her for wife to
his son &AElig;ther, and for daughter in his home.
So he sent a mighty and honourable embassy,
of earls and marquesses, with goodly company
of knights and ladies and philosophers; bidding
them, with all courtesy and discretion, pray
King Maurus to give Ursula in marriage to
&AElig;ther.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><i>"But," he said, "if Maurus will not hear
your gentle words, open to him all my heart,
and tell him that I will ravage his land with
fire, and slay his people, and make himself
die a cruel death, and will, after, lead Ursula
away with me. Give him but three days to
answer, for I am wasted with desire to finish
the matter and hold Ursula in my ward."</i></p>

<p><i>But when the ambassadors came to King
Maurus, he would not have his daughter wed a
heathen; so, since prayers and gifts did not
move him, they spoke out all the threats. Now
the land of Britain was little, and its soldiers
few, while the heathen was a mighty king and
a conqueror; so Maurus and his Queen and
his councillors, and all the people, were in
sore distress.</i></p>

<p><i>But on the evening of the second day Ursula
went into her chamber and shut close the doors,
and before the image of the Father, who is very
pitiful, prayed all night with tears, telling how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>she had vowed in her heart to live a holy
maiden all her days, having Christ alone for
spouse. But if His will were that she should
wed the son of the heathen King, she prayed
that wisdom might be given her to turn the
hearts of all that people who knew not faith or
holiness, and power to comfort her father and
mother, and all the people of her fatherland.</i></p>

<p><i>And when the clear light of dawn was in
the air she fell asleep. And the Angel of the
Lord appeared to her in a dream, saying,
"Ursula, your prayer is heard. At the sun-rising
you shall go boldly before the ambassadors
of the King of Over-sea, for the God
of Heaven shall give you wisdom, and teach
your tongue what it should speak."</i></p>

<p><i>When it was day, Ursula rose to bless and
glorify the name of God. She put on for covering
and for beauty an enwrought mantle like
the starry sky, and was crowned with a coronet
of gems. Then, straightway passing to her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>father's chamber, she told him what grace had
been done to her that night, and all that now
was in her heart to answer to the ambassadors
of Over-sea. So, though long he would not,
she persuaded her father.</i></p>

<p><i>Then Maurus, and his lords and councillors,
and the ambassadors of the heathen King,
were gathered in the Hall of Council. And
when Ursula entered the place where these
lords were, one said to the other, "Who is this
that comes from Paradise?" For she moved in
all noble gentleness, with eyes inclined to earth,
learned and frank and fair, delightful above all
women upon earth. Behind her came a hundred
maidens, clothed in white silk, fair and lovely.
They shone brightly as the stars, but Ursula
shone as the moon and the evening star.</i></p>

<p><i>Now this was the answer Ursula made,
which the King caused to be written, and sealed
with the royal seal, and gave to the ambassadors
of the King of the Over-sea.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><i>"I will take," she said, "for spouse, &AElig;ther,
the son of my lord, the King of Over-sea. But
I ask of my lord three graces, and with heart and
soul pray of him to grant them.</i></p>

<p><i>"The first grace I ask is this, that he and
the Queen and their son, my spouse, be baptized
in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.</i></p>

<p><i>"The second grace is that three years may
be given me, before the bridal, in which to go to
and fro upon the sea, that I may visit the bodies
of the Saints in Rome, and the blessed places
of the Holy Land.</i></p>

<p><i>"And for the last grace, I ask that he choose
ten fair maidens of his kingdom, and with each
of these a thousand more, all of gentle blood,
who shall come to me here in Britain, and go
with me in gladness upon the sea, following this
my holy pilgrimage."</i></p>

<p><i>Then spake one of the nobles of the land to
Maurus, saying, "My lord the King, this your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>daughter is the Dove of Peace come from Paradise,
the same that in the days of the flood
brought to the Ark of Noah the olive-branch of
good news." And at the answer were the ambassadors
so full of joy that they well-nigh could
not speak, and with praise and triumph, they
went their way, and told their master all the
sweet answer of Ursula.</i></p>

<p><i>Then my lord the King said, "Praised and
blessed be the name of our God Malcometto,
who has given my soul for comfort that which
it desired. Truly there is not a franker lady
under the wheel of the sun; and by the body
of my mother I swear there is nothing she can
ask that I will not freely give. First of the
maidens she desires shall be my daughter
Florence." Then all his lords rose, man by
man, and gladly named each his child.</i></p>

<p><i>So the will of Ursula was done; and that
King, and all his folk, were baptized into the
Holy Faith. And &AElig;ther, with the English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>maidens, in number above ten thousand, came
to the land of Britain.</i></p>

<p><i>Then Ursula chose her own four sisters,
Habila and Julia and Victoria and Aurea, and
a thousand daughters of her people, with certain
holy bishops and great lords and grave councillors,
and an abbot of the order of St. Benedict,
men full of all wisdom and friends of God.</i></p>

<p><i>So all that company set sail in eleven ships,
and passing this way and that upon the sea,
rejoiced in it, and in this their maiden pilgrimage.
And those who dwelt by the shores of
the sea came forth in multitudes to gaze upon
them as they passed, and to each man it appeared
a delightful vision. For the ships sailed
in fair order, side by side, with sound of sweet
psalms and murmur of the waters. And the
maidens were clad, some in scarlet and some
in pure samite, some in rich silk of Damascus,
some in cloth of gold, and some in the purple
robe that is woven in Judea. Some wore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>crowns, others garlands of flowers. Upon the
shoulder of each was the visible cross, in the
hands of each a pilgrim's staff by their sides
were pilgrims' scrips, and each ship's company
sailed under the gonfalon of the Holy Cross.
Ursula in the midst was like a ray of sunlight,
and the Angel of the Lord was ever with them
for guide.</i></p>

<p><i>So in the holy time of Lent they came to
Rome. And when my Lord the Pope came
forth, under the Castle of St. Angelo, with
great state, to greet them, seeing their blessed
assembly, he put off the mantle of Peter, and
with many bishops, priests, and brothers, and
certain cardinals, set himself to go with them
on their blessed pilgrimage.</i></p>

<p><i>At length they came to the land of Slavonia,
whose ruler was friend and liegeman to the
Soldan of Babylon. Then the Lord of the
Saracens sent straightway to the Soldan, telling
what a mighty company had come to his land,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>and how they were Christian folk. And the
Soldan gathered all his men of war, and with
great rage the host of the heathen made against
the company of Ursula.</i></p>

<p><i>And when they were nigh, the Soldan cried
and said, "What folk are ye?" And Ursula
spake in answer, "We are Christian folk; our
feet are turned to the blessed tomb of our Lord
Jesus Christ, for the saving of our souls, and
that we may win grace to pass into eternal life,
in the blessed Paradise." And the Soldan
answered, "Either deny your God, or I will
slay you all with the sword. So shall ye die
a dolorous death, and see your land no more."
And Ursula answered, "Even so we desire to
be sure witnesses for the name of God, declaring
and preaching the glory of His name;
because He has made heaven and earth and
the sea by His Word; and afterward all living
things; and afterward has willed, Himself, to
die for our salvation and glory. And who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>follows Him shall go to rejoice in His Fatherland
and in His Kingdom."</i></p>

<p><i>Then she turned to her people: "My sisters
and my brothers, in this place God has given
us great grace. Embrace and make it sure,
for our death in this place will be life perpetual,
and joy and sweetness never-ending. And
there, above, we shall be with the Majesty and
the angels of Paradise." Then she called her
spouse to comfort and teach him. And he
answered her with these words: "To me it
appears three thousand years that death is
a-coming, so much have I already tasted of the
sweetness of Paradise."</i></p>

<p><i>Then the Soldan gave commandment that
they should all be slain with the sword. And
so was it done.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet when he saw Ursula standing in the
midst of all that slaughter, like the fairest stalk
of corn in harvest, and how she was exceeding
lovely, beyond the tongues of this earth to tell,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>he would have saved her alive, and taken her
for wife. But when she would not, and rebuked
him, he was moved with anger. Now
there was a bow in his hand, and he set an
arrow on the string, and drew it with all his
strength, and it pierced the heart of the glorious
maiden. So she went to God.</i></p>

<p><i>And one maiden only, whose name was
Corbula, through fear hid herself in the ship.
But God, who had chosen all that company,
gave her heart, and with the dawn of the next
day she came forth willingly, and received the
martyr's crown.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus all were slain, and all are gone to
Paradise, and sing the glad and sweet songs
of Paradise.</i></p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p><i>Whosoever reads this holy history, let him
not think it a great thing to say an Our Father
and a Hail Mary for the soul of him who has
written it.</i></p>

<h3><i>THE DREAM OF ST. URSULA</i><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p><i>In the year 1869, just before leaving Venice, I
had been carefully looking at a picture by Victor
Carpaccio, representing the dream of a young
princess. Carpaccio has taken much pains to
explain to us, as far as he can, the kind of life
she leads, by completely painting her little bedroom
in the light of dawn, so that you can see
everything in it. It is lighted by two doubly-arched
windows, the arches being painted crimson
round their edges, and the capitals of the
shafts that bear them, gilded. They are filled
at the top with small round panes of glass; but
beneath, are open to the blue morning sky, with
a low lattice across them; and in the one at the
back of the room are set two beautiful white
Greek vases with a plant in each, one having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>rich dark and pointed green leaves, the other
crimson flowers, but not of any species known
to me, each at the end of a branch like a spray
of heath.</i></p>

<p><i>These flower-pots stand on a shelf which runs
all round the room and beneath the window, at
about the height of the elbow, and serves to put
things on anywhere; beneath it, down to the
floor, the walls are covered with green cloth,
but above are bare and white. The second window
is nearly opposite the bed, and in front of
it is the princess's reading-table, some two feet
and a half square, covered by a red cloth with
a white border and dainty fringe; and beside
it her seat, not at all like a reading-chair in Oxford,
but a very small three-legged stool like a
music-stool, covered with crimson cloth. On
the table are a book, set up at a slope fittest for
reading, and an hour-glass. Under the shelf
near the table, so as to be easily reached by the
outstretched arm, is a press full of books. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>door of this has been left open, and the books,
I am grieved to say, are rather in disorder,
having been pulled about before the princess
went to bed, and one left standing on its side.</i></p>

<p><i>Opposite this window, on the white wall, is a
small shrine or picture (I can't see which, for
it is in sharp retiring perspective), with a lamp
before it, and a silver vessel hung from the lamp,
looking like one for holding incense.</i></p>

<p><i>The bed is a broad four-poster, the posts being
beautifully wrought golden or gilded rods, variously
wreathed and branched, carrying a canopy
of warm red. The princess's shield is at the
head of it, and the feet are raised entirely above
the floor of the room, on a dais which projects
at the lower end so as to form a seat, on which
the child has laid her crown. Her little blue
slippers lie at the side of the bed, her white dog
beside them; the coverlid is scarlet, the white
sheet folded half way back over it; the young
girl lies straight, bending neither at waist nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>knee, the sheet rising and falling over her in a
narrow unbroken wave, like the shape of the
coverlid of the last sleep, when the turf scarcely
rises. She is some seventeen or eighteen years
old, her head is turned towards us on the pillow,
the cheek resting on her hand, as if she were
thinking, yet utterly calm in sleep, and almost
colourless. Her hair is tied with a narrow riband,
and divided into two wreaths, which encircle
her head like a double crown. The white
nightgown hides the arm, raised on the pillow,
down to the wrist.</i></p>

<p><i>At the door of the room an angel enters (the
little dog, though lying awake, vigilant, takes no
notice). He is a very small angel; his head
just rises a little above the shelf round the room,
and would only reach as high as the princess's
chin, if she were standing up. He has soft grey
wings, lustreless; and his dress, of subdued
blue, has violet sleeves, open above the elbow,
and showing white sleeves below. He comes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>in without haste, his body like a mortal one,
casting shadow from the light through the door
behind, his face perfectly quiet, a palm-branch
in his right hand, a scroll in his left.</i></p>

<p><i>So dreams the princess, with blessed eyes
that need no earthly dawn. It is very pretty
of Carpaccio to make her dream out the angel's
dress so particularly, and notice the slashed
sleeves; and to dream so little an angel&mdash;very
nearly a doll angel&mdash;bringing her the branch
of palm and message. But the lovely characteristic
of all is the evident delight of her
continual life. Royal power over herself, and
happiness in her flowers, her books, her sleeping
and waking, her prayers, her dreams, her
earth, her heaven.</i></p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p><i>"How do I know the princess is industrious?"</i></p>

<p><i>Partly by the trim state of her room&mdash;by
the hour-glass on the table, by the evident use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>of all the books she has (well bound, every one
of them, in stoutest leather or velvet, and with
no dog's-ears), but more distinctly from another
picture of her, not asleep. In that one a prince
of England has sent to ask her in marriage;
and her father, little liking to part with her,
sends for her to his room to ask her what she
would do. He sits, moody and sorrowful; she,
standing before him in a plain housewifely
dress, talks quietly, going on with her needle-work
all the time.</i></p>

<p><i>A workwoman, friends, she, no less than a
princess; and princess most in being so. In
like manner is a picture by a Florentine, whose
mind I would fain have you know somewhat,
as well as Carpaccio's&mdash;Sandro Botticelli.
